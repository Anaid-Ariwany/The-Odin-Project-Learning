    "- Variables: Containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.\n",
    "    - `var`: Function-scoped variable declaration (older way). In simpler terms, `var` is used to declare variables that can be accessed throughout the function they are defined in. eg:\n",
    "      ```javascript\n",
    "      var name = \"Alice\";\n",
    "      console.log(name); // Outputs: Alice\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `let`: Block-scoped variable declaration (modern way, allows reassignment). In simpler terms, `let` is used to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression they are defined in. eg:\n",
    "      ```javascript\n",
    "      let age = 25;\n",
    "      age = 26; // Reassignment is allowed\n",
    "      console.log(age); // Outputs: 26\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `const`: Block-scoped variable declaration (modern way, does not allow reassignment). In simpler terms, `const` is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. eg:\n",
    "      ```javascript\n",
    "      const pi = 3.14;\n",
    "      // pi = 3.14159; // This will throw an error\n",
    "      console.log(pi); // Outputs: 3.14\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - In summary:\n",
    "    - Use `var` for function-scoped variables (older practice). It is similar to `let` in that variables assigned this way can be reassigned, but it has other quirks that were cleared up when the language introduced `let` and `const`. By and large, it is not used anymore.\n",
    "    - Use `let` for block-scoped variables that may change (which we can re-assign.).\n",
    "    - Use `const` for block-scoped variables that should not change. (which we can’t re-assign and will throw an error if we try)"
