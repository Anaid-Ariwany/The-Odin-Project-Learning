    "- Variables: Containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`.\n",
    "    - `var`: Function-scoped variable declaration (older way). In simpler terms, `var` is used to declare variables that can be accessed throughout the function they are defined in. eg:\n",
    "      ```javascript\n",
    "      var name = \"Alice\";\n",
    "      console.log(name); // Outputs: Alice\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `let`: Block-scoped variable declaration (modern way, allows reassignment). In simpler terms, `let` is used to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression they are defined in. eg:\n",
    "      ```javascript\n",
    "      let age = 25;\n",
    "      age = 26; // Reassignment is allowed\n",
    "      console.log(age); // Outputs: 26\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `const`: Block-scoped variable declaration (modern way, does not allow reassignment). In simpler terms, `const` is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. eg:\n",
    "      ```javascript\n",
    "      const pi = 3.14;\n",
    "      // pi = 3.14159; // This will throw an error\n",
    "      console.log(pi); // Outputs: 3.14\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - In summary:\n",
    "    - Use `var` for function-scoped variables (older practice). It is similar to `let` in that variables assigned this way can be reassigned, but it has other quirks that were cleared up when the language introduced `let` and `const`. By and large, it is not used anymore.\n",
    "    - Use `let` for block-scoped variables that may change (which we can re-assign.).\n",
    "    - Use `const` for block-scoped variables that should not change. (which we can’t re-assign and will throw an error if we try)"

    "- Data Type: A classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold in programming. Common data types in JavaScript include:\n",
    "    - **Number:** Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: `42`, `3.14`. Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type:\n",
    "        1. `Infinity` – represents infinity; can be obtained by dividing a non-zero number by zero. eg: `1 / 0` results in `Infinity`.\n",
    "        2. `-Infinity` – represents negative infinity; can be obtained by dividing a negative non-zero number by zero. eg: `-1 / 0` results in `-Infinity`.\n",
    "        3. `NaN` (Not-a-Number) – represents a value that is not a legal number; typically results from invalid or undefined mathematical operations, such as dividing zero by zero. eg: `0 / 0` results in `NaN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **String:** Represents a sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. Example: `\"Hello, World!\"`, `'JavaScript'`. Strings are created using quotes. There are 3 types of quotes:\n",
    "        1. Double quotes`(\" \")`: \n",
    "        2. Single quotes`(' ')`:\n",
    "        3. Backticks (template literals) `(` `)`: Allow for multi-line strings and string interpolation using `${expression}` syntax. They also allow us to embed expressions within strings. In simpler terms, we can include variables or expressions directly inside a string without needing to concatenate them. Example:\n",
    "            ```javascript\n",
    "                let name = \"Alice\";\n",
    "                let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`; // Using backticks for string interpolation\n",
    "                console.log(greeting); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            \n",
    "    - **Boolean (logic type):** Represents a logical entity that can have one of two values: `true` or `false`. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Object:** A complex data type that allows you to store collections of data and more complex entities. Objects are used to represent real-world entities and can contain properties (key-value pairs) and methods (functions). Example:\n",
    "        ```javascript\n",
    "            let person = {\n",
    "                name: \"Alice\",\n",
    "                age: 30,\n",
    "                greet: function() {\n",
    "                    console.log(\"Hello, \" + this.name);\n",
    "                }\n",
    "            };\n",
    "            person.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, Alice\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Symbol:** A unique and immutable primitive value that can be used as the key of an object property (used to create unique identifiers for objects). Symbols are often used to create private or hidden properties in objects to avoid name collisions. Example:\n",
    "        ```javascript\n",
    "            let sym1 = Symbol(\"description\");\n",
    "            let sym2 = Symbol(\"description\");\n",
    "            console.log(sym1 === sym2); // Outputs: false (each symbol is unique)\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Undefined:** Represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. Example: `let x; console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Null:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a primitive value that indicates \"no value\" or \"empty value\". Example: `let emptyValue = null;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **BigInt:** Represents integers with arbitrary precision, allowing for the representation of very large integers beyond the safe integer limit for the Number type. Example: `9007199254740991n`. BigInt values are created by appending an \"n\" to the end of an integer literal or by using the `BigInt()` constructor."

    "        console.log(typeof 42); // Outputs: \"number\"\n",
