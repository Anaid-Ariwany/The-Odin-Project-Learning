    <!-- Number 1 to 3 -->
    <script>
        //1. Add 2 numbers together! In your script, type in console.log(23 + 97). Running this should log 120.
        console.log(23 + 97);

        //2. Do the same thing but add 6 different numbers together.
        console.log(50 + 85 + 10 + 63 + 20 + 4);

        //3. Now log the value of the following expression: (4 + 6 + 9) / 77. The console should log approximately 0.24675.
        console.log((4 + 6 + 9) / 77);

    <!-- Number 4 -->
    <script>
        //4. Let’s use some variables!
        //4.1. Add this statement to the script tag: let a = 10.
        let a = 10;

        //4.2. Below it, add console.log(a). When you run this, the browser console should log 10.
        console.log(a);

        //4.3. Afterwards, re-assign a with a different number value. Log a again afterwards and it should show the updated value (the previous log should still show the old value of 10 since that was before a was re-assigned).
        a = 20;
        console.log(a);

        //4.4. Now add to the bottom of the script let b = 7 * a.
        let b = 7 * a;

        //4.5. Log what b is. It should log the result of 7 multiplied by whatever you re-assigned a with.

        //5.1. Declare a const variable max with the value 57.

        //5.2. Declare another const variable actual and assign it max - 13.
        const actual = max - 13;

        //5.3. Declare another const variable percentage and assign it actual / max.
        const percentage = actual / max;

        //5.4. Now if you log percentage, you should see a value in the console like 0.7719.
        console.log(percentage);

        //5.5 log all variables to see their values.
