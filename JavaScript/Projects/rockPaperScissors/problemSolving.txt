# 1. Understanding the Problem
- Creating a rock, paper, scissors game program that takes the user's input and the computer's random input, compares them, decides a winner, and awards the winner points based on the rules of the game. 
- There are only 3 valid inputs: rock, paper, scissors
- The rules are:
    1. Rock crushes Scissors
    2. Scissors cuts paper
    3. Paper covers Rock
- The possible choices:
    1. Rock & Scissors: Rock wins
    2. Rock & Paper: Paper wins
    3. Scissors & Paper: Scissors wins


# 2. Planning
2.1. GUI:
- Does your program have a user interface? No
- What will it look like? No GUI
- What functionality will the interface have? Just display on console

2.2 Inputs:
- What inputs will your program have? 
    - numberOfRounds
    - humanChoice
    - computerChoice
- Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
    - numberOfRounds: prompt user to enter how many rounds they want to play
    - humanChoice: prompt user to enter choice
    - computerChoice: computer randomly chooses using math.random functions

2.3. Outputs:
- What’s the desired output?
    - humanChoice and computerChoice
    - humanScore and computerScore
    - Winner of the game

2.4. Necessary Steps:  
- Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?
    - The user must decide how many game rounds they want to play
    - The inputs are then taken, lowercased, and compared
    - The scores are increamented depending on the winner of that round and the number of rounds are decreamented
    - The total scores are given at the end of each game and a winner declared


# 3. Pseudocode
    1. Program starts
    2. Initialize numberOfRounds, humanChoice, computerChoice, humanScore=0, and computerScore=0
    3. User is prompted to enter number of rounds they want to play = numberOfRounds
    4. User makes a choice (Rock/Paper/Scissors) = humanChoice
    5. Computer randomly makes a choice (Rock/Paper/Scissors) = computerChoice
    6. Loop the game till number of rounds <=0
        - for (i=numberOfRounds; i<=0; --i){
            7. Choices are compared:
                - if ((humanChoice==rock && computerChoice==scissors) ||
                    (humanChoice==paper && computerChoice==rock) ||
                    (humanChoice==scissors && computerChoice==paper)) {
                        humanScore = ++humanScore;
                        numberOfRounds = --numberOfRounds;
                        console.log("humanChoice: "+humanChoice+ " computerChoice: "+computerChoice+ " humanScore: "+humanScore+" computerScore: "+computerScore+" Rounds left: "+numberOfRounds)
                    }
                    else{
                        computerScore = ++computerScore;
                        numberOfRounds = --numberOfRounds;
                        console.log("humanChoice: "+humanChoice+ " computerChoice: "+computerChoice+ " humanScore: "+humanScore+" computerScore: "+computerScore+" Rounds left: "+numberOfRounds)
                    }

                    console.log("humanChoice: "+humanChoice+ " computerChoice: "+computerChoice+ " humanScore: "+humanScore+" computerScore: "+computerScore+" Rounds left: "+numberOfRounds)
        }
