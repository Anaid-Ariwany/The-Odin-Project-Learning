    "- HTML on its own is naturally responsive to some extent. For example, block-level elements like `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>` automatically adjust their width to fit the screen size.\n",
    "- Once you add CSS, the responsiveness can be affected depending on the styles applied.\n",
    "- To maintain natural responsiveness:\n",
    "    1. **Use the Viewport Meta Tag:** \n",
    "         ```html\n",
    "         <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n",
    "         ```\n",
    "         This sets the initial width of the webpage to the size of the actual screen you’re viewing it on, and telling it not to zoom in or out.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Avoid fixed widths & heights:** Instead of using fixed pixel values for widths, use relative units like percentages (`%`), `em`, or `rem`. This allows elements to scale based on the screen size. Also, use `max-width` instead of `width` to allow elements to shrink on smaller screens and `min-width` to prevent them from becoming too small.\n",
    "        - **Avoid heights altogether:** Let the content dictate the height of elements. Fixed heights can lead to overflow issues on smaller screens. Use `min-height` if necessary.\n",
    "        - **Fixed weidths:** Used px on things that you don't want to be responsive. For example, buttons, icons, sidebars, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. **Use Flexbox and Grid:** CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts are designed to be flexible and can adapt to different screen sizes more easily than traditional layout methods.\n",
    "        - Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts (either row or column).\n",
    "        - Grid is better for two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns)."
